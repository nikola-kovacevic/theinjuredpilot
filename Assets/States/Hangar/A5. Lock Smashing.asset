  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly
    trash.


    You could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one
    of the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind
    of leverage, maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.


    How
    to proceed?

    1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.

    2. Take
    the time to build a leverage-gadget.'
